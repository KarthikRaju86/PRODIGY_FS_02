# Employee Management System using Python, HTML & CSS

# Overview
This is a task assigned by ProdigyInfotech as part of my Full Stack Web Development internship with them.
To develop an Employee Management System with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for employee records using Python and Flask, here's a detailed step-by-step guide. This guide includes setting up the environment, creating the necessary files, and implementing the core functionality.

# Employee Management System Overview

The application will allow administrators to:

Create: Add new employee records.

Read: View employee details and employee list.

Update: Edit existing employee records.

Delete: Remove employee records from the system.

Flask, SQLAlchemy (for database handling), and Flask-WTF (for form handling).

# Technologies used
# Python: 
Handles backend logic, employee details, and session management.

# HTML:
Used to structure the user interface for different views in the application, such as login, registration forms, and employee dashboards.

# CSS:
Styles the frontend, ensuring the application is responsive and visually appealing. CSS is used to create a clean and user-friendly design, allowing users to easily navigate through the system.
